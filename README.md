# Problem

There is list of rectangles with different (known) widths and heights.

How to pack those rectangles around center point - like this:

# Algorithm

Divide the area around the central point into 4 quadrants.

Divide the rectangles into 4 subsets of approximately equal total area.

Use a standard bin packing algorithm to pack each quadrant with its assigned rectangles.

# Result

Here is how it looks with 50 boxes of random sizes
